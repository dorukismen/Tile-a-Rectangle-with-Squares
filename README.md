# Tile-a-Rectangle-with-Squares

Given an n × m grid (where n,mn,m are integers), we would like to tile it with the minimal number of same size squares. Clearly, it can always be tiled with nm squares of size 1 × 1, but it is not always optimal. For example, a 6 × 10 grid can be tiled by 15 squares of size 2 × 2. 

My goal in this problem is to implement a function squares(n, m) that returns the minimum number of same size squares required to tile a grid of size n × m.
